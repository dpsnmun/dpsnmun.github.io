				It gives me immense pleasure to invite you all to the inaugural edition of  Delhi Public  School Noida Model United Nations Conference. DPSNMUN'14 to be held on Tuesday, December 2 and Wednesday, December 3, 2014 in collaboration with UNIC.
				<br><br>
				DPSN has evolved as one of the premier educational institutions of the country. With 'education' acquiring new connotations and spanning wider dimensions, the school is alive to the challenge of moulding a new generation of students into a genre of well integrated personalities equipped with the life skills necessary to take up future challenges.
				<br><br>
				Model United Nations (also Model UN or MUN) is an academic simulation of the United Nations that aims to educate participants about current events, topics in international relations, diplomacy and the United Nations agenda. The participants role-play as diplomats representing a country or NGO in a simulated session of a committee of the United Nations, such as the Security Council or the General Assembly. Participants research a country, take on roles as diplomats, investigate international issues, debate, deliberate, consult, and then develop solutions to world problems.
				<br><br>
				Considering the importance of the concerns we are trying to raise through the MUN Conference, we hope you can help facilitate the execution of this ambitious project which aims to develop, inspire and activate young minds to become aware citizens and to find logical solutions to 'day to day' problems.
				<br><br>
				The MUN Club, initiated in DPS NOIDA in 2004 has been highly popular with students and has brought many laurels to the school at various MUN conferences, conducted all over India.
				With a firm commitment to finding consensus, no matter how much opinions may vary, and in firmly upholding our motto "Service before Self", we hope that DPSNMUN will satisfy each and every expectation you have ever had from an MUN.
				<br><br>
				Quoting former Secretary General, United Nations, Mr.  Kofi Annan, "To live is to choose. But to choose well, you must know who you are, and what you stand for, where you want to go and why you want to get there."
				<br>
				On behalf of the entire Organizing Committee, I welcome you all to Delhi Public School Noida Model United Nations Conference. <br>
				With best wishes<br>
				<br><br>
				Kamini Bhasin<br>
				Principal<br>
				Delhi Public School Noida
